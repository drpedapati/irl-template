## ✅ Before Each Loop — Checklist to run before every iteration

- Script designed to be **idempotent**
- **Version control**: clean tree (`git status`), commit baseline, `.gitignore` enforced
- The **only permitted modification** is within the `## One-Time Instructions` section.
- New agents: review existing outputs before recreating; don’t overwrite unless explicitly instructed. Seek clarification if unsure.

## 📝 After Each Loop — Steps to complete after every iteration

> Uncomment your preferred options below.

- update commit, push, build and brew

- **Update activity log**
  - Use timestamps **only** when sequencing or causality matters
  - In `plans/main-plan-activity.md`, write 1–2 lines describing:
    - What you did
    - Timestamp
    - Git hash
  <!-- Optional CSV logging -->
  <!--
  - In `plans/main-plan-activity.csv`, add 1 row:
    - What you did
    - Timestamp
    - Git hash
  -->

- **Update plan log**: Update `plans/main-plan-log.csv`

- **Version control**: Commit intended changes only; verify no ignored or unintended files staged.

- **Give feedback to the AUTHOR** — concise and actionable:
  1. What was done, decisions needed, next steps
  2. Identify anything breaking idempotency, or obsolete/outdated instructions
  3. Identify critical reasoning errors
