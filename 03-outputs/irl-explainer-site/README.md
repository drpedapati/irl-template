# IRL Explainer Site (Draft)

Open `index.html` in a browser.

Handy commands:
- `make serve` (then open `http://localhost:8765`)
- `make smoke` (starts a server briefly and verifies `index.html` loads)

Notes:
- The page renders diagrams client-side via the `beautiful-mermaid` CDN, so it needs an internet connection.
- If you want to serve it locally: `python3 -m http.server` from this folder, then open `http://localhost:8000`.
