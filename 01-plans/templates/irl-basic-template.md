pre-instruction hooks:
- please make a surgical git commit before edits
- do not edit this file under any circumstance

overall strategy:
- [Describe your high-level approach, tools, and formatting preferences]
- [Specify output formats and organization]
- [Define coding standards if applicable]
- For each instruction set, render a pair of files that share the same basename:
    - Reasoning Plan (.md): Record the intended instructions, their order, and the rationale at a high level, without results or execution details; keep it short and editable to steer or revise the downstream work.
    - Executed Document (.qmd, .py, .R, etc.): Implement and execute the full instruction set, including code, analysis, and outputs, producing the authoritative rendered result.
    - The basename should be consistent with the task number/name (e.g., task-01, task-02, or descriptive names like analysis-cohort-01)
    - The .md file captures thinking and order, the executed file captures execution and results and they are always side by side in the same location
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is recommended for executable documents (.qmd) as it supports code execution, narrative text, and multi-format rendering (HTML, PDF, Word). See the [Quarto Guide](https://github.com/drpedapati/irl-template/wiki/Quarto-Guide) for details.

Instruction sets:

Task 1: [Task description]
    - [Specific instructions for this task]

Task 2: [Task description]
    - [Specific instructions for this task]


Clean up rules:
Will provide explicit remove: and archive: and reactivate: blocks when needed
- Archive: move instruction set and output to archive folder
- Remove: delete instruction set and output
- Reactivate: move instruction set and output to active folder


Post Instruction hooks:
- For each completed task, update the paired reasoning plan (.md) with a high-level outline reflecting the current executed document structure, including all major sections, subsections, and tables/figures so that this reasoning plan can be edited to steer downstream work. User comments/revisions from previous edits should be moved to "revision notes" section at the end with instructions to ignore on rerun.
- [Update outputs/indexes as needed]
- give direct, essential feedback to user for edits needed to align the current file based on your actions.
    - obsolete or outdated instructions
    - breaking idempotency
    - critical thinking errors
    - output should be 1-2 lines, elegant and formatted
    - whats the next step if any?
- render outputs after every change (no warnings/errors that affect output integrity).
- make a surgical git commit of your edits
- update logs/activity_log.csv
    Maintain a CSV-based log of activity include timestamps only when sequencing or causality matters.
