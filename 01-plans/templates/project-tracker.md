overall strategy:
- Single source of truth for project tasks and schedule
- Tasks tracked in 03-outputs/tasks.csv
- Timeline/Gantt in 03-outputs/schedule.md
- Weekly review and update cycle
- Status: not_started | in_progress | blocked | done

project metadata:
- Project: [Name]
- Start date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- Target end: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- Team: [Names/roles]

task schema (tasks.csv):
- id: unique identifier (P001, P002...)
- task: description
- owner: responsible person
- status: not_started | in_progress | blocked | done
- priority: high | medium | low
- due: YYYY-MM-DD
- depends_on: comma-separated task ids
- notes: brief context

Instruction sets:

Task 1: Initialize tracker

    - Create 03-outputs/schedule.md with timeline view
    - Add initial task list below

Task 2: Add/update tasks
    - [Task description] | [owner] | [priority] | [due] | [depends_on]

    - Risks: potential delays or issues


Milestones:
- M1: [Description] | [Date]
- M2: [Description] | [Date]
- M3: [Description] | [Date]


Clean up rules:
- Archive: move completed project trackers to 03-outputs/archive/
- Done tasks remain in CSV for history

Post Instruction hooks:
- Update tasks.csv with any changes
- Regenerate schedule.md timeline view
- Calculate: total tasks, % complete, overdue count
- Provide feedback:
