# IRL Plan: Coding Project

## Structure
Create on first run:
- src/
- tests/
- docs/
- logs/

## Pre-instruction Hooks
- git commit before edits
- do not edit this file

## Project Metadata
- Name: [Project name]
- Language: [Python/Go/TypeScript/etc.]
- Description: [One-line description]

## Strategy
- Test-driven: write tests alongside implementation
- Document as you go: README, inline comments
- Small commits: one logical change per commit
- Conventional commits: feat:, fix:, docs:, test:, refactor:

## Tasks

### Task 1: Setup
- Initialize project structure
- Setup dependency management (requirements.txt, go.mod, package.json)
- Create README.md with project overview
- Configure linting/formatting

### Task 2: [Feature/Component]
- Design: [what it does, inputs/outputs]
- Files: [where it lives]
- Tests: [what to verify]

### Task 3: [Feature/Component]
- Design: [what it does]
- Files: [where it lives]
- Tests: [what to verify]

## Testing
- Unit tests for functions/methods
- Integration tests for components
- Run tests before each commit
- Target coverage: [X%]

## Documentation
- README.md: overview, setup, usage
- docs/architecture.md: system design
- docs/api.md: public interfaces (if applicable)

## Post-instruction Hooks
- Run tests, report pass/fail
- Run linter, fix or report issues
- Feedback: files changed, tests status, next step
- git commit with conventional message
- Update logs/activity.md
