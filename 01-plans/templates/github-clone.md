# IRL Plan: GitHub Clone Project

## Setup
Create on first run:
- plans/
- repo/
- notes/
- logs/

## Before Each Run
- git commit before edits
- do not edit this file

## Project Metadata
- Repository URL: [https://github.com/owner/repo]
- Branch: [main/master/feature-branch]

## Codebase Analysis
Before making changes, understand the project:
- [ ] README reviewed

## Approach
- Clone first, understand before changing
- Follow existing conventions (naming, structure, style)
- Run existing tests before modifications
- Small, focused commits matching project style
- Document findings in notes/ for future reference

## Tasks

### Task 1: Clone and Setup
- Clone repository to repo/
- Checkout target branch
- Install dependencies

## After Each Run
- Run tests, report pass/fail
- Feedback: files changed, test status
- git commit with descriptive message
- Update logs/activity.md
