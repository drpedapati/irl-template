# IRL Plan: Quarto Documentation Project

## Setup
Create on first run:
- plans/
- plans/_quarto.yml (website config)
- plans/index.qmd (landing page)
- plans/design/ (RFC-style design docs)
- plans/archive/ (retired instruction sets)
- data/raw/
- data/derived/
- outputs/
- logs/
- logs/decision-log.csv

## Before Each Run
- Make a surgical git commit before edits
- Do not edit this file unless instructed

## Project Metadata
- Name: [Project name]
- Purpose: [One-line description]
- Output: Quarto website with integrated documentation

## Strategy

### Documentation Framework
- Output: Quarto website rendered from plans/
- Reference: https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/websites.html
- Use callouts, tabs, and cross-references strategically
- Organization: scalable hierarchy (overview → details → appendices)

### Formatting Standards
- Academic style: APA 7 (headings, citations, tables/figures, tone)
- Layout: NIH-style (generous margins, readable typography)
- Use dense prose to explain reasoning and steps
- Tables and figures with formal captions

### Paired File Strategy
For each instruction set, create two files sharing the same basename:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `NN_name.md` | **Reasoning plan**: intended approach, order, rationale. Short, editable, steers downstream work. |
| `NN_name.qmd` | **Executed document**: implementation, code, analysis, outputs. Renders into the Quarto website. |

The .md captures thinking; the .qmd captures execution. Always side-by-side.

### Coding Standards
- Prefer linear scripts over deeply nested functions
- Explain each code listing clearly and concisely
- Group related code; avoid excessive code blocks
- Deliverables must be reproducible and self-contained
- Minimize file outputs to avoid directory clutter

## Instruction Sets

### 01: [First task]
- [Instructions for this task]

### 02: [Second task]
- [Instructions for this task]

## Maintenance Rules
Apply explicitly when needed:
- **Archive**: Move instruction set and outputs to plans/archive/
- **Remove**: Delete instruction set and outputs entirely
- **Reactivate**: Restore from archive to active folder

## After Each Run
1. Render Quarto website (ensure no warnings/errors)
2. Make surgical git commit of changes
3. Update logs/decision-log.csv with:
   - What was decided
   - Why it was reasonable
   - What evidence supported it
   - How it was validated
4. Provide feedback (1-2 lines):
   - Flag obsolete instructions
   - Note idempotency issues
   - Highlight critical gaps

## Tools
- Git CLI (version control)
- Quarto CLI (rendering)
- Prefer `trash` over `rm -rf` for safe deletion
