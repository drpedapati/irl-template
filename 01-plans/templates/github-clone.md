# IRL Plan: GitHub Clone Project

## Setup
Create on first run:
- repo/              # Cloned repository lives here
- notes/             # Analysis and understanding docs
- patches/           # Staged changes before PR
- logs/

## Before Each Run
- git commit before edits
- do not edit this file

## Project Metadata
- Repository URL: [https://github.com/owner/repo]
- Branch: [main/master/feature-branch]
- Purpose: [bug fix / feature / learning / fork]
- Upstream tracking: [yes/no - will you PR back?]

## Codebase Analysis
Before making changes, understand the project:
- [ ] README and CONTRIBUTING.md reviewed
- [ ] License identified: [MIT/Apache/GPL/etc.]
- [ ] Build system: [make/npm/cargo/go/etc.]
- [ ] Test framework: [jest/pytest/go test/etc.]
- [ ] Code style: [prettier/black/gofmt/etc.]
- [ ] CI/CD: [GitHub Actions/CircleCI/etc.]

## Approach
- Clone first, understand before changing
- Follow existing conventions (naming, structure, style)
- Run existing tests before modifications
- Small, focused commits matching project style
- Document findings in notes/ for future reference

## Tasks

### Task 1: Clone and Setup
- Clone repository to repo/
- Checkout target branch
- Install dependencies
- Run build to verify setup
- Run existing tests (note any failures)

### Task 2: Explore Codebase
- Identify entry points (main, index, cmd/)
- Map key modules and their responsibilities
- Note patterns used (error handling, logging, config)
- Document architecture in notes/architecture.md

### Task 3: Understand Target Area
- Locate files related to your change
- Read related tests to understand expected behavior
- Identify integration points and dependencies
- Note any gotchas or edge cases

### Task 4: Implement Changes
- Create feature branch: [branch-name]
- Make minimal, focused changes
- Follow existing code style exactly
- Add/update tests as appropriate
- Update documentation if needed

### Task 5: Validate
- Run full test suite
- Run linter/formatter
- Manual testing of changes
- Review diff for unintended changes

### Task 6: Prepare Contribution (if PRing back)
- Rebase on latest upstream
- Squash/organize commits per project guidelines
- Write clear commit messages
- Draft PR description

## Contribution Checklist
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Linter/formatter satisfied
- [ ] No unrelated changes in diff
- [ ] Commit messages follow project style
- [ ] PR description explains what and why
- [ ] Linked to issue (if applicable)

## After Each Run
- Run tests, report pass/fail
- Run linter, report status
- Feedback: files changed, test status
- git commit with descriptive message
- Update logs/activity.md
