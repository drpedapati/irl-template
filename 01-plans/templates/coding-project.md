pre-instruction hooks:
- make a surgical git commit before edits
- do not edit this file under any circumstance

overall strategy:
- Software development using IRL pattern for planning and documentation
- Code lives in 02-data/src/ (or appropriate language convention)
- Documentation and design notes in .qmd files alongside code
- Tests in 02-data/tests/ or language-appropriate location
- For each major feature/component, maintain paired files:
    - Design doc (.qmd): Architecture decisions, API design, usage examples
    - Implementation: Actual source code files
- Use 03-outputs/ for builds, generated docs, coverage reports

project metadata:
- Project: [Name]
- Language: [Python/R/Go/TypeScript/etc.]
- Description: [One-line purpose]
- Dependencies: [Key libraries/frameworks]

directory structure:
- 01-plans/main-plan.md (this file)
- 02-data/src/ (source code)
- 02-data/tests/ (test files)
- 03-outputs/docs/ (generated documentation)
- 03-outputs/build/ (compiled artifacts)
- 04-logs/activity_log.csv

Instruction sets:

Task 1: Project setup
    - Initialize language-specific project structure
    - Set up dependency management (requirements.txt, go.mod, package.json, etc.)
    - Create initial README.qmd with project overview
    - Configure linting/formatting tools

Task 2: [Feature/Component name]
    - Design: [What it should do, inputs/outputs, edge cases]
    - Implementation notes: [Approach, key decisions]
    - Test cases: [What to verify]
    - Files: [List of files to create/modify]

Task 3: [Feature/Component name]
    - Design: [What it should do]
    - Implementation notes: [Approach]
    - Test cases: [What to verify]
    - Files: [List of files]


Testing strategy:
- Unit tests for individual functions/methods
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Run tests before each commit
- Target coverage: [X%]

Documentation:
- README.qmd: Project overview, setup, usage
- ARCHITECTURE.qmd: System design, component relationships
- API.qmd: Public interfaces, examples (if applicable)
- Render to 03-outputs/docs/ as needed


Clean up rules:
- Archive: move deprecated code to 02-data/archive/ with dated prefix
- Remove: delete generated files, clean build artifacts
- Refactor: update design docs when implementation changes

Post Instruction hooks:
- Run tests, report pass/fail count
- Run linter, fix or report issues
- Update design docs if implementation diverged
- Feedback format:
    - Files changed: [list]
    - Tests: [X passed, Y failed]
    - Next: [suggested next step]
- make a surgical git commit
- update logs/activity_log.csv
