# Main Plan Activity

- 2026-02-08 (c157e9b): Created draft IRL explainer site in `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/`.
- 2026-02-08 (187b982): Served `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/` locally on `http://localhost:8765` and smoke-tested `index.html`.
- 2026-02-08 (d0b0241): Added `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/Makefile` and ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (a1957c2): Added ZeroTier access notes + `make ips`/`make zt` helpers; ran `make smoke` and `make ips`.
- 2026-02-08 (84aab57): Executed `make -C 03-outputs/irl-explainer-site smoke` (no artifact changes expected).
- 2026-02-08 (58bf5e0): Reviewed senior feedback in `/Users/ernie/Dropbox/Henry Projects/irl-feedback` and revised `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/index.html` (monochrome layout, deeper prose, more diagrams, added interactive toy); ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (c5cdb02): Re-read feedback docs and iterated on `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/index.html` (more prose, underline-only link color, focus-visible a11y); ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (d65bb49): Reviewed `typography-feedback.md` and applied additional typography tweaks (narrower content width, h2 divider, h3 size) to `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/index.html`; ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (a2e4cf2): Pulled updated `explainer-site-skill` (skill repo HEAD `8a5ccd1`) and revalidated site with `make -C 03-outputs/irl-explainer-site smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (61909a3): Reviewed explainer-skill demo guidance (`how-memory-works`) and added a Practical Commands section/table to `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/index.html`; ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (c5c19a3): Iterated on explainer aesthetics to match sample elegance (subtle monochrome background shading + improved title block); ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (dae294b): Updated `explainer-site-skill` (skill repo HEAD `2849c0a`) and applied its frosted-glass header pattern to `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/index.html`; ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (65f881b): Improved header whitespace + added author byline to `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/index.html`; ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (e5fdfbb): Removed artifact-path callout from `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/index.html`; ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (924dbf3): Re-downloaded explainer skill v1.5.0 (header design section); confirmed site already matches pattern — no header changes needed. Added early plain-language explanation of "idempotent" in the lede for non-technical readers; updated Section 5 opener to back-reference it; ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (b7ec19a): Added interactive idempotency toy to Section 5 — simulates running a step repeatedly with identical output to demonstrate the concept for non-technical readers; ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (604ed4f): Redesigned title area — centered layout, new main title "AI Work You Can Retrace" (non-technical), "Idempotent Research Loop" as monospace subtitle below, byline inside centered block; updated `<title>` tag and smoke test; ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (742cc97): Replaced opening paragraphs with author's new text (cooking/recipe analogy), removed table of contents, cleaned up dead nav CSS; idempotency back-reference updated to recipe metaphor; ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (98fad19): Tightened opening paragraphs to author's revised text — 5 lede paragraphs condensed to 4, sharper recipe analogy, merged idempotent definition into IRL explanation paragraph; ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (cf3f9eb): Created `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/toys.html` — separate toy playground page with idempotent vs. non-idempotent side-by-side contrast toy; validated both pages serve correctly.
