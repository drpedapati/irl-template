# Main Plan Activity

- 2026-02-08 (c157e9b): Created draft IRL explainer site in `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/`.
- 2026-02-08 (187b982): Served `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/` locally on `http://localhost:8765` and smoke-tested `index.html`.
- 2026-02-08 (d0b0241): Added `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/Makefile` and ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (a1957c2): Added ZeroTier access notes + `make ips`/`make zt` helpers; ran `make smoke` and `make ips`.
- 2026-02-08 (84aab57): Executed `make -C 03-outputs/irl-explainer-site smoke` (no artifact changes expected).
- 2026-02-08 (58bf5e0): Reviewed senior feedback in `/Users/ernie/Dropbox/Henry Projects/irl-feedback` and revised `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/index.html` (monochrome layout, deeper prose, more diagrams, added interactive toy); ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (c5cdb02): Re-read feedback docs and iterated on `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/index.html` (more prose, underline-only link color, focus-visible a11y); ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (d65bb49): Reviewed `typography-feedback.md` and applied additional typography tweaks (narrower content width, h2 divider, h3 size) to `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/index.html`; ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (a2e4cf2): Pulled updated `explainer-site-skill` (skill repo HEAD `8a5ccd1`) and revalidated site with `make -C 03-outputs/irl-explainer-site smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (61909a3): Reviewed explainer-skill demo guidance (`how-memory-works`) and added a Practical Commands section/table to `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/index.html`; ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (c5c19a3): Iterated on explainer aesthetics to match sample elegance (subtle monochrome background shading + improved title block); ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (dae294b): Updated `explainer-site-skill` (skill repo HEAD `2849c0a`) and applied its frosted-glass header pattern to `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/index.html`; ran `make smoke`.

- 2026-02-08 (e5fdfbb): Removed artifact-path callout from `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/index.html`; ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (924dbf3): Re-downloaded explainer skill v1.5.0 (header design section); confirmed site already matches pattern — no header changes needed. Added early plain-language explanation of "idempotent" in the lede for non-technical readers; updated Section 5 opener to back-reference it; ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (b7ec19a): Added interactive idempotency toy to Section 5 — simulates running a step repeatedly with identical output to demonstrate the concept for non-technical readers; ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (604ed4f): Redesigned title area — centered layout, new main title "AI Work You Can Retrace" (non-technical), "Idempotent Research Loop" as monospace subtitle below, byline inside centered block; updated `<title>` tag and smoke test; ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (742cc97): Replaced opening paragraphs with author's new text (cooking/recipe analogy), removed table of contents, cleaned up dead nav CSS; idempotency back-reference updated to recipe metaphor; ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (98fad19): Tightened opening paragraphs to author's revised text — 5 lede paragraphs condensed to 4, sharper recipe analogy, merged idempotent definition into IRL explanation paragraph; ran `make smoke`.
- 2026-02-08 (cf3f9eb): Created `03-outputs/irl-explainer-site/toys.html` — separate toy playground page with idempotent vs. non-idempotent side-by-side contrast toy; validated both pages serve correctly.
- 2026-02-08 (66000f0): Redesigned toys page with animated canvas-based visuals — seeded RNG dot constellations (idempotent side always same pattern, non-idempotent side drifts + accumulates), cubic ease-out animation, HiDPI canvas, monochrome palette; validated both pages serve.
- 2026-02-08 (aca3f66): Redesigned toy with two-phase animation (scatter out → settle in), constellation lines connecting nearby dots, teal/amber color palettes, 5:3 aspect ratio; both sides animate every run; validated both pages serve.
- 2026-02-08 (84577f9): Added Toy 2 "The Recipe" to `toys.html` — animated flow visualization showing Plan → AI → Artifacts with cubic bezier particle paths, fading trails, and accumulating artifact rectangles; validated both pages serve.
- 2026-02-08 (f91be00): Redesigned Toy 2 as "The Loop" — triangular layout with HUMAN (reason·plan) and AI (execute) nodes, three bezier loop paths (plan/execute/review) with arrowheads, three-phase animation with node glow, and accumulating artifacts at bottom; validated both pages serve.
- 2026-02-08 (91644f5): Densified loop toy — bigger nodes (0.13), larger labels (15px/12px/11px), bigger particles/arrows/artifacts, auto-plays 3 cycles on load with 900ms gap; validated both pages serve.
- 2026-02-08 (9da3fd4): Iterated on loop toy per feedback — enlarged all labels (20px/15px/14px nodes, 15px paths), replaced "ARTIFACTS" with "FILES" for non-technical clarity, bigger file rectangles (24x28), larger nodes (0.15), tighter canvas (5:2.5), updated captions/text to avoid jargon, fixed HTML ellipsis; confirmed explainer skill unchanged (still v1.5.0 @ 2849c0a); validated both pages serve.
- 2026-02-08 (8cec869): Added Toy 3 "The Process" to `toys.html` — DOM-based animated walkthrough of one IRL cycle showing real content: plan file types in (ERP summary task), AI executes with pulsing status, output file appears with actual data table, git diff + commit; auto-plays on load with Replay button; validated both pages serve.
- 2026-02-08 (9464b9e): Revised Toy 3 to use actual IRL Basic Template structure — plan content now shows Before Each Loop checklist + Instruction Loop with real paths (02-data/raw/survey.csv → 03-outputs/report.html), output renamed from summary.html to report.html, diff references both report.html and activity.md; removed unused logText variable; validated both pages serve.
- 2026-02-08 (64f1dbb): Redesigned Toy 3 as side-by-side layout — plan on left with all three sections (Before Each Loop, Instruction Loop, After Each Loop) that highlight during execution; outputs accumulate on right; runs two loops with a revision ("add confidence intervals") appearing between them to demonstrate iterative refinement; removed git diff (too technical), kept checkpoint saves; auto-plays on load; validated both pages serve.
- 2026-02-08 (a21900e): Made Toy 3 plan content realistic for data scientists — 5-step analysis pipeline (load CSV, filter, compute stats, t-test, render), proper statistical output (group means, SD, t-test, p-value), revision adds 95% CI + effect size with Cohen's d in v2; Before Each Loop now includes `git status` and data integrity check; After Each Loop references `plans/activity.md` and `git add`; validated both pages serve.
- 2026-02-08 (bea0940): Made loop toy arrows more prominent — path opacity 0.15→0.35, line width 1.5→2px, dash pattern [3,4]→[8,4]; arrowhead size 9→14px, opacity 0.35→0.7; validated both pages serve.
- 2026-02-08 (b84ab9b): Replaced file rectangles with single growing report document in loop toy — "REPORT v1/v2/v3" card with content lines that grow each cycle, fresh lines highlighted in teal; validated both pages serve.
- 2026-02-08 (516ecb0): Added accumulating activity hints to loop toy — IRL instruction snippets pop in and persist in canvas margins (human left, AI right), fade in over 600ms, older hints dim progressively, rotate per cycle; validated both pages serve.
- 2026-02-08 (216ec8c): Updated Toy 2 intro/aside captions to reflect report output and accumulating instruction trail; Toys 1 and 3 captions verified accurate — no changes needed; validated both pages serve.
