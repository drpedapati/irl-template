pre-instruction hooks:
- make a surgical git commit before edits
- do not edit this file under any circumstance

overall strategy:
- Iterative manuscript development with versioned drafts
- Use Quarto (.qmd) for manuscripts with embedded analysis
- Render to Word/PDF for submission, HTML for review
- Track changes via git diffs, not Word track changes
- Reference management: BibTeX in references.bib

manuscript metadata:
- Working title: [Title]
- Target journal: [Journal name]
- Word limit: [if applicable]
- Authors: [List]
- Status: [outline/draft/revision/submitted]

structure:
- 03-outputs/manuscript.qmd - main document
- 03-outputs/figures/ - generated figures
- 03-outputs/tables/ - generated tables
- 02-data/references.bib - bibliography

Instruction sets:

Task 1: Outline
    - Create structured outline with:
        - Introduction (background, gap, objective)
        - Methods (design, participants, measures, analysis)
        - Results (primary, secondary outcomes)
        - Discussion (interpretation, limitations, implications)
    - Identify key references needed

Task 2: Methods section
    - [Specific methods to describe]
    - Include: participants, measures, procedures, analysis plan

Task 3: Results section
    - [Key findings to report]
    - Tables needed: [list]
    - Figures needed: [list]

Task 4: Introduction
    - Background context
    - Gap in literature
    - Study objective/hypothesis

Task 5: Discussion
    - Key findings interpretation
    - Comparison to prior work
    - Limitations
    - Implications and future directions

Task 6: Abstract
    - Structured abstract per journal guidelines
    - [word limit]


Clean up rules:
- Archive: move old drafts to 03-outputs/archive/
- Keep current working version as manuscript.qmd

Post Instruction hooks:
- Render manuscript after each edit (quarto render)
- Update word count in activity log
- Flag any sections exceeding typical length
- Provide feedback:
    - Sections completed/modified
    - Outstanding sections
    - Reference gaps
- make a surgical git commit
- update logs/activity_log.csv with section, word count, status
