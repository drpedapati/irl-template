This isn't a sales pitch. There's no subscription, no platform to commit to, no app that'll be obsolete in six months. What you're reading is a way of thinking about AI the way you think about a stethoscope: nobody taught you "how to use the Littmann Cardiology IV." They taught you auscultation. The instrument is interchangeable. AI works the same way. The products change fast, and if your entire workflow lives inside one company's interface, you're starting over every time the market shifts.

The physicians who'll get the most out of AI aren't the ones chasing the newest app. They're the ones who understand what AI actually is: a process tool. It's fast at retrieval, summarization, and grinding through large volumes of text. It doesn't get tired or lose focus on page 40 of a literature review. But it can't tell whether the question you're asking is the right question. It can't notice that a study's population doesn't match yours, or that a statistical result is technically correct but clinically meaningless. That's hybrid cognition: you bring the judgment, the context, the "wait, that doesn't fit." The AI brings speed and consistency. Neither one is sufficient alone. The skill is learning how to combine them.

### Toy 2: Hybrid Cognition

**aside:** Here's what that looks like in practice. Same literature review, two approaches. Watch what happens.

#### AI Alone (amber side)

| Step | Marker | Label | Detail |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | ok | Searched 847 papers | 3 minutes. Every database, every keyword combination. |
| 2 | ok | Filtered to 23 relevant studies | Title, abstract, methods. Standard inclusion criteria. |
| 3 | ok | 12 show positive outcomes | Effect sizes extracted. Forest plot generated. |
| 4 | ok | Conclusion: strong evidence for efficacy | Confident summary delivered. Ready for your protocol. |
| 5 | fail | Missed: 4 studies used adult cohorts | Your patients are pediatric. The finding doesn't transfer. |

**verdict:** Fast. Thorough. Confident. Wrong.

#### AI + You (teal side)

| Step | Marker | Label | Detail |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | ok | Searched 847 papers | Same speed. Same coverage. AI handles this. |
| 2 | ok | Filtered to 23 relevant studies | You scan the list. Criteria look reasonable. |
| 3 | you | You: "4 of these used adult populations" | You know your patients. AI doesn't. |
| 4 | ok | Re-analyzed: 8 applicable studies | AI re-runs with your filter. Takes 30 seconds. |
| 5 | ok | Moderate evidence. Gaps identified. | Honest conclusion. Knows what it doesn't know. |

**verdict:** Fast. Checked. Honest. Useful.

#### Footer text (progressive, per step)

| Step | AI Alone | AI + You |
|------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Searching... | Searching... |
| 2 | Filtering by inclusion criteria. | Filtering. You're watching. |
| 3 | Extracting effect sizes. | You flag a problem. |
| 4 | Done. Conclusion delivered. | AI re-runs your revised query. |
| 5 | Confident. Complete. Wrong. | Accurate. Honest. Useful. |
| final footer | Nobody caught the error. | You caught it in 10 seconds. |

## 1. App-Based AI vs. Professional AI Skills

**subhead:** Two ways to use AI. One makes you dependent on a product. The other makes you better at your work.

### Prose

Most physicians first encounter AI through apps. A chatbot with a friendly interface, a "summarize this" button in a note-taking tool, a pre-built template inside some commercial platform. And look, those can be useful. But they're training you to rely on someone else's decisions about what AI should do and how. When the app changes its interface, raises its price, or just disappears? Your "AI skills" go with it.

The alternative is developing process skills you actually own. You learn to write clear instructions for any AI. You learn to structure a task so you can review the output properly. You learn to catch errors, request revisions, build on previous work. These skills are yours. They work across every AI system, and they compound over time.

### Toy 1: App-Based AI vs. Process Skills

**aside:** The comparison below walks through the key differences. Notice how app-based AI locks your workflow to a product, while process skills give you something portable and lasting.

#### App-Based AI (amber side)

| Icon | Label | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| :iphone: | Vendor interface | Your workflow lives inside their product. Their buttons, their layout, their way of doing things. |
| :lock: | Locked-in data | Your prompts, your context, your history. All on their servers, in their format. |
| :money_with_wings: | Subscription dependency | Stop paying (or the company pivots) and your access disappears. |
| :arrows_counterclockwise: | Starts over | New version, new interface, new learning curve. Previous work? Might not transfer. |
| :clipboard: | Pre-built templates | Someone else decided what to ask and how to structure things. You just fill in blanks. |

**verdict:** You learned an app. When it changes, you start over.

#### Process Skills (teal side)

| Icon | Label | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| :memo: | Your instructions | A plain text file with your reasoning, your questions, your structure. Any AI can read it. |
| :open_file_folder: | Your files | Inputs, outputs, revisions. All on your computer. Nothing stored in a platform. |
| :unlock: | No lock-in | Switch providers tomorrow. Your plan files and your process work exactly the same. |
| :chart_with_upwards_trend: | Compounds over time | Each project builds on the last. Instructions get sharper, reviews get faster. |
| :brain: | Your expertise drives it | You decide what matters, what to check, when to push back. The AI executes. You direct. |

**verdict:** You developed a skill. It works with any tool, forever.

#### Footer text (progressive, per item)

| Step | App-Based | Process Skills |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | Open the app, find the feature. | Open any text editor, write what you need. |
| 2 | Your work lives on their servers. | Your work lives on your machine. |
| 3 | Access requires a subscription. | Access requires a text file. |
| 4 | Platform changes, you adapt. | AI changes, your process stays. |
| 5 | Their templates, their choices. | Your reasoning, your structure. |
| final | Product knowledge has a shelf life. | Process skills compound indefinitely. |

## 2. What Process Skills Look Like in Practice

**subhead:** A repeatable method that works with any AI, for any task.

### Prose

The structure is simple. You write down what you want the AI to do in plain text. Your inputs, your assumptions, what the output should look like. The AI reads those instructions and produces files: a summary, a draft, a data table. You review what came back, note what needs to change, and run it again. Each round gets better because the instructions accumulate your reasoning.

Honestly, it's not that different from working with a research assistant or a med student. You wouldn't hand someone a stack of papers and say "do something useful." You'd give them a specific question, point them to the relevant sources, tell them what format you need. Then you'd review their work and give feedback. AI works the same way. The difference? It never gets tired, never takes the feedback personally, and can reprocess everything from scratch in minutes.

The plan file is where your reasoning lives. It's a plain text document any AI can read. No proprietary format, no lock-in. Switch from one AI to another and the plan file still works. Your instructions, your accumulated revisions, your quality checks, all of it travels with you.

## 3. Why This Matters for Physicians

**subhead:** Clinical judgment isn't something you outsource. AI should amplify it, not replace it.

### Prose

You're already trained to synthesize complex information under uncertainty. That's exactly the skill AI needs from you. An AI can search a database, summarize 50 papers, draft a protocol. But it can't decide whether the question is the right question. It can't judge whether the summary missed the one finding that changes the clinical picture. It won't notice that the protocol makes an assumption that doesn't hold for your patient population.

Your job isn't to "use AI." Your job is to direct it with the same rigor you bring to everything else in medicine. Write down your reasoning. Specify what you need. Review the output the way you'd review a resident's note. Push back when something's wrong. The AI gets better because *your instructions* get better, not because the software got an update.

This approach also protects you. When your workflow is a documented series of instructions and reviewed outputs, you've got a clear record of what was done and why. You can trace any result back to the reasoning that produced it. That matters for reproducibility, for clinical documentation, and for your own confidence in the work.

## 4. Getting Started

**subhead:** You don't need to install anything. Just a text file and access to any AI assistant.

### Prose

Pick one question you want AI to help with. A literature search, a data summary, a draft of a methods section. Write down what you want in a plain text file: what the input is, what you're assuming, what the output should look like. Give those instructions to an AI and see what comes back.

That's the whole method. Write instructions. Run them. Review the output. Revise based on what you learned. Each round makes the work better and your instructions sharper. Over time you build a library of plan files that capture how you think about different problems. That library is your AI skill set, and it works with whatever tool you happen to be using.

For a hands-on walkthrough applied to a real task, try the [literature review tutorial](lit-review.html), which goes from first instructions to finished output. For a broader look at the pattern and its components, see the [main explainer](draft.html).
